# st

This is my own patched build of the simple terminal.
There is a list of patches called 'patches.txt'.

This is the terminal i use for several hours on a daily basis.
It has scrollback, a nord theme, liguatures, boxdraw and a cursor that takes the color of the text it is on.

Here is a screenshot of it, running Neovim, Nerdtree and minimap.vim
